# open.mp-zombies-gamemode
The Last Of Survivor Beta
```pawn
NOTE: THESE HAVE NO ZOMBIE NPCS, AS THEY ARE NOT INCLUDE
NPCS THAT ARE SUITABLE FOR INSTALLING IN OPEN MP, I ORIGINALLY WANT THE FCNPC INCLUDE PORT BUT
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO COMPILE C++ SO THAT IT MAKES INCLUDE & PLUGIN, SO YES THE PROBLEM IS
THAT THE NPCS YOU CAN ADD THEM YOURSELF

IF THERE IS A BUG, YOU FIX IT YOURSELF,
BECAUSE I ALSO CHANGED THE BCRYPT SYSTEM SO THAT IT SUPPORTS OPEN.MP
